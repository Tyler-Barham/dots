# Window manager

## Prerequisites
Due to running home-manager/Nix on a distro other than NixOS, some dependencies should be managed by your local package manager (alternatively, feel free to mess with [nixGL](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL) if you can be bothered...) Â 
E.g.
```
sudo zypper install lightdm awesome picom rofi pulseaudio upower
```
<sub>* Note that we use awesome v4.3, not awesome-git</sub>
